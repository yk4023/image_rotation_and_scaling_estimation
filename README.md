# Effective estimation of image rotation angle and rescaling factor using spectral method

The authors of paper , provide this MATLAB toolbox only for research purposes
(evaluation and comparison of this method with other methods).

It contains:

- `estimate_factor_and_angle.m`:    main function to estimate scaling factor and rotation angle using the proposed method in [1]
- `Example.m`:     example of usage of the method
- `Lena.tiff`:     test image (downloaded from the USC-SIPI image database)
- `README.md`:     this readme info
- `image-rotation-angle-estimation`:   The matlab estimation toolbox from [2] Padin and [3] C. Chen
